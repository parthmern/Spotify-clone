## 💚 Challanges that i have faced 

### ✔️ How i created this with only 100 api limits of RapidApi
➜ Actually, i created almost 50 fake / bypassed accounts with the RapidApi and <br/>
➜ during code [**Api key Handling Strategy**] , if there is 429 ( client error ) then it moved to another Api key to fetch the same data (like recursive function) . <br/>
➜ Sorry but I am not going to reveal method of getting unlimited fake gmails to bypass the signup route. <br/>
➜ You can also find code in `src > components > utils > api.js` = [direct link](https://github.com/parthmern/Spotify-clone/blob/master/src/components/utils/api.js) <br/>
➜ I know that i should add this sensitive data to the `.env` file but only you can understand the "Api key handling strategy" through code so that i have uploaded on same file insted of storing sensitive data in `.env` file. <br/>

### ✔️ Infinite scrooling Library
➜ It is not working with my project like the NEXT api fetching function is not hitting , i also tried to solve this but i was failed. <br/>
➜ So i decided to create my own "Infinite scrolling" fetaure. <br/>
